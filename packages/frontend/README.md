# Lil Nouns Preview

## This is a work in progress


The goal of this project is to allow you to preview what lil noun you would get if you settled and began a new auction in the same block shown on screen. The noun you get is not guaranteed based on this information.

This project is still in active development on both the frontend and smart contract side. Smart contract code can be found [here](https://github.com/nvonpentz/preview-lil-nouns)

NEW contract deploy (subject to change): `0x6c3810649c140d2f43Ec4D88B2f733e1375E4C74`
OLD contract deploy (subject to change): `0xA1879c5dC7049106f641cC5C3A567e7ABF31035C`
